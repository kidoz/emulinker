# EmuLinker

EmuLinker is a Kaillera (http://www.kaillera.com/) network server. Kaillera is a client/server system that virtually any emulator can implement to enable network play, by mapping "Player 2" input to another user over the Internet using network communication.  EmuLinker is a complete rewrite of the original Kaillera network server for the purpose of preventing exploitable bugs and adding features.

This is a port of the project from SourceForge (https://sourceforge.net/projects/emulinker) to GitHub by the original author (Paul Cowan, https://github.com/monospacesoftware) on 6/25/2015.  I am concurrently changing the license to GPL 2.0.  No code has changed since 2006.
